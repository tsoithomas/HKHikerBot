## Introduction

The hiking app “HKHikerBot” is a chatbot for users to discover the best hiking routes in Hong Kong, providing searching, viewing and voting functions. The app also allows users to send the current location to find nearby hiking routes. To build the chatbot successfully, different types of cloud-based technologies and programming languages are applied.
